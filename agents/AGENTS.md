# Copilot Instructions — dmtools-agents

## Architecture

This is a **generic agents repository** (typically used as a git submodule at `agents/` inside product repos). It orchestrates AI-driven Agile delivery via [dmtools](https://github.com/nicku/dmtools) — a Java tool that provides a GraalJS runtime for agent scripts.

### Execution model

1. **SM Agent** (`sm.json` → `js/smAgent.js`) runs on a cron schedule, queries Jira via JQL rules, and dispatches specialized agents by triggering GitHub Actions workflows.
2. **Agent configs** (root `*.json` files) define individual agent jobs. Three job types exist:
   - `Teammate` — CLI-based agent (prepares context → runs AI CLI → post-processes result)
   - `JSRunner` — pure GraalJS logic executed inside dmtools (no AI CLI)
   - `TestCasesGenerator` — dmtools-native job for test case generation
3. **Project config** lives in the target repo at `.dmtools/config.js`, never here. This repo stays project-agnostic.

### Key layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| SM rules | `sm.json`, `sm_merge.json` | JQL-based ticket routing |
| Agent configs | root `*.json` | Job definitions (type, params, actions) |
| JS runtime scripts | `js/` | Pre/post actions, orchestration logic |
| Shared helpers | `js/common/` | SCM abstraction, Jira helpers, PR logic |
| Config system | `js/configLoader.js` + `js/config.js` | Discovery, merging, defaults |
| Prompts | `prompts/` | Markdown entry prompts for CLI agents |
| Instructions | `instructions/` | Reusable instruction packs (review, dev, rework, platform, tracker, scm) |
| Setup scripts | `setup/` | Shell scripts for CI environment setup |

## GraalJS Constraints

All `js/` runtime code executes in **dmtools GraalJS**, not Node.js.

- Use `var` declarations and plain functions (no `let`/`const`, no arrow functions, no async/await, no template literals).
- No Node.js APIs: no `fs`, `path`, `process`, `Buffer`, `child_process`, no npm packages.
- No browser APIs: no `fetch`, `window`, `document`.
- Use dmtools globals: `jira_*`, `github_*`, `ado_*`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `cli_execute_command`.
- Local `require('./module.js')` works only for files within this repo.
- Keep data structures JSON-safe.

## Running Tests

Tests run **standalone** inside dmtools GraalJS via the custom test runner. The repo is independent — no parent repo or submodule mount needed.

```bash
# Run from the dmtools-agents repo root
cd dmtools-agents

# All tests
dmtools run js/unit-tests/run_all.json

# Single test suite
dmtools run js/unit-tests/run_smAgent.json
dmtools run js/unit-tests/run_configLoader.json
```

Each `run_*.json` specifies which test files to load. Tests use `loadModule()` with mock injection — see `js/unit-tests/testRunner.js` for the framework API (`test()`, `suite()`, `assert.*`, `loadModule()`, `makeRequire()`).

### Writing tests for new logic

**All new JS logic must be covered by unit tests before committing.**

- Create or extend a `js/unit-tests/test_<module>.js` file.
- Add it to the corresponding `run_<module>.json` (or create a new one) and include it in `run_all.json`.
- Use `loadModule('js/your-module.js', makeRequire({...}), { globalMock: fn })` to isolate the module.
- Mock all dmtools globals (`file_read`, `file_write`, `cli_execute_command`, `jira_*`, `github_*`, etc.) — never let tests call real services.
- Block config file discovery in mocks: return `null` for any path containing `.dmtools/config` to prevent loading a parent repo's real config.
- Project-specific test suites (loading files from `.dmtools/`) must guard with a file-existence check so they skip gracefully in standalone context.

Example mock pattern:
```js
var fileReadMock = function(opts) {
    var p = opts && (opts.path || opts);
    if (fileMap[p] !== undefined) return fileMap[p];
    if (p && p.indexOf('.dmtools/config') !== -1) return null; // block real config
    try { return file_read(opts); } catch (e) { return null; }
};
```

### Live end-to-end testing without an AI CLI

Unit tests cover JS logic with mocks, but a Teammate agent's full wiring
(preJSAction → input context → preCliJSAction → CLI → postJSAction) can also
be exercised against **real Jira/Confluence/etc.** without invoking the real
AI CLI (`scripts/run-agent.sh`). Two dmtools features make this possible:

1. **CLI param overrides** — `dmtools run <config.json> --key value` patches
   the `params` block. Values that look like JSON arrays/objects are parsed as
   JSON, so even `cliCommands` and `customParams` can be overridden:

   ```bash
   dmtools run agents/story_solution.json \
     --inputJql "key = PROJ-123" \
     --cliCommands '["/path/to/fake_cli.sh"]' \
     --customParams '{"contentOutput":{"target":"confluence","space":"DOC","parentPageId":"123456"}}' \
     --alwaysPostComments false \
     --cleanupInputFolder false
   ```

2. **A fake CLI script** that mimics the agent contract: read `input/`, write
   `outputs/response.md` (and any other files the post-action expects, e.g.
   `outputs/confluence_replies.json`). Keep it outside the repo (it is
   project- and machine-specific):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   mkdir -p outputs
   printf '# Fake output\n\nGenerated by the e2e fake CLI.\n' > outputs/response.md
   ```

Rules for live e2e runs:

- **Never commit live-e2e configs or scripts to this repo** — they contain
  real ticket keys, page IDs and space keys, which violates the
  project-agnostic rule. Keep them in a scratch directory or pass everything
  via CLI overrides.
- Run against **dedicated garbage objects** (a test ticket and a test
  Confluence page clearly marked "safe to delete"), never real work items.
- Pass `--cleanupInputFolder false` so you can inspect `input/<KEY>/`
  afterwards, and `--alwaysPostComments false` to keep the test ticket quiet.
- After the run, verify the side effects directly (e.g. `jira_get_ticket`,
  `confluence_content_by_id`, `confluence_get_page_inline_comments`) rather
  than trusting the job log.

## Conventions

### No project-specific content — STRICT RULE

**This is a public, product-agnostic repository. NEVER commit anything company- or customer-specific here.** Violations are a fireable offense and require history rewrite.

Forbidden anywhere in this repo (code, comments, prompts, instructions, tests, docs, commit messages):

- Company, customer, or product names
- Internal hostnames, URLs, IPs, Jira/Confluence links, real ticket keys
- Internal label/branch/repo naming conventions tied to one organization
- File paths pointing to internal repos, internal registry URLs
- Sample data copied from real internal systems

Everything here must be **generic and configurable**: names like `example.com`, `PROJ-123`, `acme`; behavior driven by `customParams` / `.dmtools/config.js` in the consuming repo. Project context goes in the target repo's `.dmtools/config.js` or the corporate orchestrator repo — never here.

**Before every commit**: re-read your diff and check it against this list.

### Agent config structure
- `metadata.contextId` identifies the workflow (used for config composition lookups).
- `preJSAction` / `preCliJSAction` / `postJSAction` — GraalJS hooks that run before/after the CLI agent.
- `cliPrompt` — path to the main prompt markdown.
- `cliPrompts` — additional prompt files appended to the CLI agent input.
- `cliCommands` — shell scripts invoked by dmtools to run the AI CLI.

### Label-based idempotency
SM rules use `skipIfLabel` / `addLabel` to prevent re-processing tickets. When adding new rules, always include an idempotency label.

### SCM abstraction
Use `js/common/scm.js` (via `configLoader.createScm(config)`) instead of calling `github_*` or `ado_*` globals directly. This keeps agents portable between GitHub and Azure DevOps.

### Config composition
Project repos customize agent behavior through `.dmtools/config.js` fields:
- `cliPrompts.<contextId>` — append prompt files to a specific agent's CLI input
- `cliPromptOverrides.<contextId>` — replace the entry prompt for a specific agent
- `additionalInstructions.<contextId>` — append to `agentParams.instructions` for a specific agent
- `instructionOverrides.<contextId>` — replace `agentParams.instructions` for a specific agent
- `agentParamPatches.<contextId>` — patch `agentParams` fields for a specific agent
- `globalCliPrompts` — prompt files appended to **every** agent's CLI input (inject-to-all)
- `globalAdditionalInstructions` — instruction files appended to **every** agent's `agentParams.instructions`

**Example — inject codegraph into all agents without repeating per context:**
```js
// .dmtools/config.js
module.exports = {
    globalCliPrompts: [
        './agents/instructions/common/codegraph_tools.md'
    ],
    cliPrompts: {
        story_development: ['./.dmtools/prompts/development_focus.md'],
        pr_review:         ['./.dmtools/prompts/review_focus.md']
        // codegraph_tools.md is injected automatically into all agents above
    }
};
```

Global entries are merged **after** per-agent entries so they always appear last.

### SM rules override and custom agents
`js/smAgent.js` supports full and partial SM customization from `.dmtools/config.js`.

**Precedence**
- Base rules come from `sm.json` (`jobParams.rules`)
- If `config.smRules` is set, it **fully replaces** base rules
- If `config.smRuleOverrides` is set, it patches rules by `configFile`

**Common use cases**
- Disable most default rules and keep only one:
```js
module.exports = {
  smRuleOverrides: {
    "agents/story_questions.json": { enabled: true },
    "agents/story_development.json": { enabled: false },
    "agents/pr_review.json": { enabled: false }
  }
};
```

- Full replacement with custom agents:
```js
module.exports = {
  smRules: [
    {
      description: "Run only custom intake flow",
      jql: "project = {jiraProject} AND issuetype = Story AND status = 'To Do'",
      configFile: "agents/my_custom_intake.json",
      skipIfLabel: "sm_my_custom_intake_triggered",
      addLabel: "sm_my_custom_intake_triggered",
      enabled: true
    }
  ]
};
```

**Rule fields supported by SM**
- `description`, `jql`, `configFile` (required for practical execution)
- `enabled` (set `false` to disable)
- `skipIfLabel` / `skipIfLabels`, `addLabel`
- `targetStatus`, `limit`, `localExecution`
- `configPath` (per-rule project config override for multi-project orchestration)

### Figma design lookup
Any agent that writes or reviews requirements-facing content (questions, descriptions, acceptance criteria, solution/design analysis, dev/test scoping) must treat the linked Figma design as a primary source, not an optional nice-to-have — a story/question/AC that ignores an available design is incomplete, the same way ignoring the code would be.

- **If a ticket/story already links a specific Figma file or node** (a `/file/` or `/design/` URL, optionally with `node-id`): open it directly with `figma_get_file_structure` / `figma_get_layers` / `figma_download_image_of_file` (see `instructions/common/media_handling.md`) before writing output.
- **If only a team- or project-level Figma URL is known** (e.g. a `.../team/<teamId>/...` "files" listing link, typically stored as project config rather than on the ticket itself): resolve it top-down with `figma_list_team_projects` → `figma_list_project_files` to find the file matching the current feature/epic, then drill into it as above. Match by file name against the feature/epic name; if no file name matches, say so explicitly rather than silently skipping the design check.
- **If the design is genuinely unavailable** (no link resolves, access error, no matching file after searching): say so explicitly in the output instead of proceeding as if no design existed — this is the same "unavailable artifact" handling already required by `instructions/common/acceptance_criteria_quality.md`.
- Never fabricate UI/UX details (copy, layout, states) that should come from Figma — pull them from the design or ask a question, don't guess.
- This is process guidance, not a project config — the actual team/project URLs and file-naming convention for a given product live in that product's `.dmtools/instructions/goal/goal.md` or `.dmtools/config.js`, never here.

### Output JSON discipline
When agents produce JSON output files, keep them compact (status, IDs, paths, short summaries). Put large text in separate `.md` files and reference them by path.

### Path stability
Do not rename or move root `*.json` config files — CI workflows and Jira automations reference them by path. Safe refactors: splitting prompt markdown, adding instruction files, adding `cliPrompts` composition in target repos.
