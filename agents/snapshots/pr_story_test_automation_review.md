### [2] `./agents/instructions/common/agent_task_preamble.md`

You are an agent triggered to perform a specific task. All required context — ticket description, PR diff, CI status, and related materials — has already been prepared in the `input/` folder. Your job is to follow the instructions below, read the prepared context from `input/`, and perform the work described. Do not ask for identifiers; the context is already available locally.

### [8] `./agents/instructions/pr_test_automation_review/few_shots.md`

Example PR test automation review outputs — keep concise:

### outputs/pr_review.json
```json
{
  "recommendation": "BLOCK",
  "summary": "Test uses hardcoded selectors and sleeps instead of explicit waits. Architecture violates layered design.",
  "generalComment": "outputs/pr_review_general.md",
  "inlineComments": [
    {"path":"testing/tests/TEST-123/test_login.py","line":34,"body":"🚨 BLOCKING: Hardcoded selector — Use Page Object method login_page.username_field instead of raw page.locator('#user').","severity":"BLOCKING"},
    {"path":"testing/tests/TEST-123/test_login.py","line":45,"body":"🚨 BLOCKING: time.sleep(5) — Replace with Playwright's expect(...).to_be_visible(timeout=5000).","severity":"BLOCKING"},
    {"path":"testing/tests/TEST-123/test_login.py","line":12,"body":"⚠️ IMPORTANT: Missing config.yaml — Each test folder must include config.yaml with framework, platform, and dependencies.","severity":"IMPORTANT"},

  ],
  "issueCounts": {"blocking":2,"important":1,"suggestions":1}
}
```

### outputs/pr_review.json (APPROVE example)
```json
{
  "recommendation": "APPROVE",
  "summary": "Test correctly exercises the ticket's acceptance criteria with self-sufficient data and proper architecture.",
  "generalComment": "outputs/pr_review_general.md",
  "inlineComments": [],
  "issueCounts": {"blocking":0,"important":0,"suggestions":0}
}
```

### outputs/pr_review_general.md
```markdown
## Automated Test PR Review — BLOCK

**Summary**: Test contains hardcoded selectors and time.sleep(), violating architecture and determinism rules. Missing config.yaml.

**Next Steps**:
1. Extract selectors into LoginPage Page Object
2. Replace time.sleep() with explicit waits
3. Add config.yaml with framework/platform/dependencies
```

### [9] `./agents/instructions/scm/github_pr_review_format.md`

# GitHub PR review format

- `outputs/pr_review_general.md` uses GitHub Markdown.
- `inlineComments[].body` uses GitHub Markdown.
- Use `path`, `line`, optional `startLine`, and `side`.
- Use `side: "RIGHT"` for new code unless commenting on removed code.
- `resolvedThreadIds` contains GitHub review thread IDs from `pr_discussions_raw.json`.



---

### [10] `./agents/prompts/story_test_automation_review_prompt.md`

> Role: Senior QA Engineer & Code Reviewer
> Task: Review the bulk test automation Pull Request for a Story.

## Context files you must read

- `input/{STORY_KEY}/ticket.md`
- `input/{STORY_KEY}/linked_test_cases.md`
- `input/{STORY_KEY}/pr_info.md`
- `input/{STORY_KEY}/pr_diff.txt`
- `input/{STORY_KEY}/pr_discussions.md`
- `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/` for each linked Test Case

## Review checklist

1. Every linked Test Case has a corresponding automated test under `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/`.
2. Each test folder contains `README.md` and `config.yaml`.
3. Tests use the correct layers: `tests/` → `components/` → `frameworks/` → `core/`.
4. No raw Flutter locators or `WidgetTester` calls directly in ticket test files.
5. Tests are deterministic, isolated, and include proper assertions and teardown.
6. Tests match the Test Case description and acceptance criteria verbatim.
7. No dead code, debug prints, or commented-out experiments.
8. Shared helpers are reused; no unnecessary duplication.

## Output files

You MUST write the following files before finishing:

1. `outputs/response.md` — concise tracker-agnostic Markdown summary of the review (1-2 paragraphs).
2. `outputs/pr_review.json` — structured data for the GitHub PR review.
3. `outputs/pr_review_general.md` — brief general PR comment (1-2 paragraphs max).
4. `outputs/pr_review_comments/` — directory with individual inline comment files (only if you have inline comments).

## Output format for `outputs/pr_review.json`

```json
{
  "recommendation": "APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|BLOCK",
  "summary": "...",
  "generalComment": "outputs/pr_review_general.md",
  "resolvedThreadIds": [],
  "inlineComments": [
    {
      "path": "testing/tests/TS-124/...",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "💡 **Suggestion**: ...",
      "severity": "BLOCKING|IMPORTANT|SUGGESTION"
    }
  ],
  "issueCounts": {
    "blocking": 0,
    "important": 0,
    "suggestion": 0
  }
}
```

- `recommendation` rules:
  - `APPROVE` only when all blocking checks pass.
  - `REQUEST_CHANGES` for issues that can be fixed by the rework agent.
  - `BLOCK` only for fundamental misunderstandings of the Test Case.
- If `pr_discussions.md` is present and contains resolved review threads, include their IDs in `resolvedThreadIds`.
- Validate `outputs/pr_review.json` as parseable JSON before stopping.

## Inline comment line mapping (CRITICAL)

Every `inlineComments` entry MUST correspond to an actual line in `input/{STORY_KEY}/pr_diff.txt`. Review comments that are not anchored to the diff are posted as noisy top-level PR comments instead of review threads.

1. Read `input/{STORY_KEY}/pr_diff.txt` before choosing line numbers.
2. For each issue, pick the exact line number shown in the diff hunk for that file.
   - For **new or modified files**, use the new/resulting line number and `side: "RIGHT"`.
   - For **deleted files**, use the original line number from the `--- a/...` side and `side: "LEFT"`.
   - For **removed lines** inside a modified file, use the original line number and `side: "LEFT"`.
3. If an issue applies to a whole file and no specific diff line exists (e.g. a missing file), put it in `outputs/pr_review_general.md` instead of creating a generic `line: 1` inline comment.
4. Do NOT use `line: 1` as a default. If you cannot find a matching diff line, move the comment to the general comment or omit it.
5. Prefer fewer, high-quality inline comments over dozens of generic line-1 comments.

Example:
```json
{
  "path": "testing/tests/TS-123/test_ts_123.py",
  "line": 45,
  "side": "RIGHT",
  "body": "🚨 BLOCKING: ...",
  "severity": "BLOCKING"
}
```

## cliPromptsByTracker

### Tracker: `jira`

#### [1] `./agents/instructions/tracker/jira_comment_format.md`

# Jira tracker comment

Use Jira wiki markup in `outputs/response.md`.

- Headings: `h1.`, `h2.`, `h3.`
- Bullets: `* item`
- Numbered lists: `# item`
- Bold: `*text*`
- Inline code: `{{code}}`
- Code block: `{code}...{code}`
- Link: `[title|url]`

Do not use Markdown headings, fenced code blocks, or backtick inline code.

**IMPORTANT** When answering a clarification question about a user story, get the parent story for full context using: `dmtools jira_get_ticket PARENT-KEY` (the parent key is visible in the ticket's parent field).



---

### Tracker: `ado`

#### [1] `./agents/instructions/tracker/ado_comment_format.md`

# ADO tracker comment

Use GitHub-flavored Markdown in `outputs/response.md` for Azure DevOps work item comments and descriptions.

- Headings: `#`, `##`, `###`
- Bullets: `- item` or `* item`
- Numbered lists: `1. item`
- Bold: `**text**`
- Inline code: `` `code` ``
- Code block: ` ```lang ... ``` `
- Link: `[title](url)`
- Tables: standard GFM table syntax

Do not use Jira wiki markup (`h1.`, `*text*`, `{code}`, `[title|url]`) in ADO fields.

**IMPORTANT** When answering a clarification question about a user story, get the parent story for full context using: `dmtools ado_get_work_item PARENT-KEY` (the parent key is visible in the ticket's parent field).

**IMPORTANT** When enhancing story descriptions, check child tickets and parent story for better context using: `dmtools ado_search_by_wiql`.
