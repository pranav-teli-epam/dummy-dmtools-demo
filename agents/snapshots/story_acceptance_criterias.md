### [2] `./agents/instructions/common/agent_task_preamble.md`

You are an agent triggered to perform a specific task. All required context — ticket description, PR diff, CI status, and related materials — has already been prepared in the `input/` folder. Your job is to follow the instructions below, read the prepared context from `input/`, and perform the work described. Do not ask for identifiers; the context is already available locally.


---

### [3] `./agents/instructions/story_acceptance_criterias/workflow.md`

You must write response to the request to outputs/response.md according to formatting rules
Don't write Acceptance Criteria for TICKET-XXX, just start from the content.
Content from the response.md file will replace the Acceptance Criteria field fully. Do not include any intro or ticket reference.
Your task is to write a clear, testable enhanced story-ready Acceptance Criteria field. Do not rewrite the tracker Description field.
if you did not understand the task, or you can't finish it with right quality **IMPORTANT** mention it at the top of the output keeping any existing content.
**IMPORTANT** If the story involves any custom graphics, icons, or illustrations: (1) specify in ACs that all graphic assets must be produced as modern designer-quality SVG (scalable, clean paths, no raster artifacts); (2) include an AC that SVG assets must be converted to PNG using an SVG-to-PNG converter (e.g. sharp, Inkscape CLI, svgexport, or equivalent) for any platform or context that does not support SVG natively; (3) specify expected dimensions and resolution for PNG exports.
**IMPORTANT** For any story that touches UI: include ACs that enforce visual quality — (1) all text and icon colours must meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text/icons) against their background; (2) no grey-on-white or light-on-light colour combinations unless contrast is explicitly verified; (3) placeholder text must be distinguishable from entered text but still readable; (4) all colours must come from the project style guide or design tokens, no arbitrary hex values.

### [4] `./agents/instructions/common/media_handling.md`

Images and attachments are pre-downloaded to the input folder. Read them directly — no extra API call is needed.

To download a Figma design image use the terminal command:
dmtools figma_download_image_of_file <<EOF
{
  "href": "https://www.figma.com/design/asdsadasdasdasd/Business-App?m=auto&node-id=NODEID&t=ASdasdsadas-1"

### [6] `./agents/prompts/acceptance_criteria_prompt.md`

**IMPORTANT** Your task is to write an enhanced story-ready Acceptance Criteria field using the configured formatting rules. User request is in the `input` folder; read all files there and do what is requested.

**You MUST follow the Acceptance Criteria Quality Rules defined in `acceptance_criteria_quality.md` throughout this entire task. These rules take priority over any default patterns.**

Always read these files first if present:
- `request.md` — full ticket details and requirements
- `comments.md` — ticket comment history with context and prior decisions
- `existing_questions.json` — clarification questions with answers; treat answered questions as binding requirements
- any other files in the input folder — attachments, designs, references

Use the configured formatting rules to write the final output to `outputs/response.md`.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT SHAPE:** The response must contain the following sections in this order. Do not skip any section. If a section has no confirmed details, include `<bullet> Not identified from available context.`

<bullet> *Story Points:*
<bullet> *Business Context:*
<bullet> *User Story:*
<bullet> *Design / Mockups:* — link to Figma or attach mockup images. If design is required but unavailable, add `*⚠ BLOCKER:*` with a description of what is missing.
<bullet> *Acceptance Criteria:* — numbered list. Each AC must be self-contained: include the rule, the trigger, and the expected outcome in the AC text itself. Do not assume the reader will search Confluence or the spec.
<bullet> *Existing vs New Behavior:* — table with columns `||Behavior||Existing||New / Changed||`. List every behavior touched by this story. Mark unchanged copied behaviors as `Copied as-is from {source}`.
<bullet> *Business Rules:*
<bullet> *Out of Scope:*
<bullet> *Source References:* — list every source read: Jira tickets, Confluence pages, Figma links, attachments. Mark any source that was inaccessible with ⚠.

### [7] `./agents/instructions/common/confluence_comments.md`

# Confluence output

Active only when the agent is configured to publish its output to Confluence (`contentOutput.target` is `confluence` or `both`). If `input/confluence_output_target.json` is not present, skip this instruction entirely.

## Output format

When `input/confluence_output_target.json` is present, your output is published to a Confluence page:

- Write `outputs/response.md` as **Markdown** — it is converted to Confluence storage format on publish. Do NOT use tracker-specific markup (no Jira `{code}` / `h2.` / ADF), even if other instructions ask for it; Markdown wins for this output.
- If `input/confluence_output_current.md` exists, it contains the page's current content — iterate on it instead of rewriting from scratch.

## Reading comments

`input/confluence_output_comments.md` lists inline (annotation) comments left on the existing Confluence page for this ticket, and `input/confluence_output_current.md` contains the page's current content.

- Treat **unresolved** comments as review feedback: if a comment points out a mistake, asks a question, or requests a clarification, address it in the updated output.
- Already **resolved** comments need no action, but may provide useful context.

## Replying to comments

When your update directly answers an unresolved comment, add a reply entry to `outputs/confluence_replies.json`. The file must be a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "pageId": "12345678",
    "commentId": "98765432",
    "body": "Fixed — the section now covers this case."
  }
]
```

Rules:

- Only reply when the update genuinely addresses the comment.
- `pageId` and `commentId` must come from `input/confluence_output_comments.md`.
- Keep replies concise and professional.
- If no comment needs a reply, omit the file or write an empty array `[]`.

# Enhanced Story Template Guidelines

The block below is a **structural template / example only**. The tags such as `<bold>`, `<bullet>`, and `<heading2>` are placeholders that show the required shape of the document.

**CRITICAL: Never write the final `outputs/response.md` using these literal metatags.** Use the tracker-specific transformation table (for example `agents/instructions/tracker/jira_markup_transform.md` when the tracker is Jira) to convert every placeholder into the correct tracker markup.

```mermaid

## Rules

- The template above is a structural example. Replace every `<bold>`, `<italic>`, `<strike>`, `<underline>`, `<code>`, `<codeblock>`, `<bullet>`, `<numbered>`, `<heading1>`, `<heading2>`, `<heading3>`, `<link>`, `<image>`, `<quote>`, `<panel>`, `<color>`, and `<hr>` placeholder with the equivalent markup defined in the tracker-specific transformation table.
- Do NOT leave literal XML-style tags such as `<bold>` or `<code>` in the final `outputs/response.md`.
- Do NOT use Markdown syntax in Jira output: no `**bold**`, no `- item` bullets, no `# headings`, no triple backticks.
- Use the tracker-specific link format when referencing tickets or URLs.

**IMPORTANT**: Read `input/existing_questions.json` for answered questions as context. Use `dmtools` CLI commands for full ticket details.

**IMPORTANT**: Check child tickets and parent story for better context using the appropriate `dmtools` search command.

#### [2] `./agents/instructions/tracker/jira_markup_transform.md`

# Jira Markup Reference

When the target tracker is Jira, replace every generic placeholder tag from the template with the Jira wiki markup shown below. Do not write literal XML-style tags in the final output.

| Generic placeholder | Jira wiki markup | Example |
|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| `<bold>X</bold>` | `*X*` | `*Background:*` |
| `<italic>X</italic>` | `_X_` | `_hint_` |
| `<strike>X</strike>` | `-X-` | `-deprecated-` |
| `<underline>X</underline>` | `+X+` | `+important+` |
| `<code>X</code>` | `{{X}}` | `{{main.dart}}` |
| `<codeblock>X</codeblock>` | `{code}X{code}` | `{code}void main() {}{code}` |
| `<codeblock:lang>X</codeblock:lang>` | `{code:lang}X{code}` | `{code:dart}void main() {}{code}` |
| `<bullet> text` | `* text` | `* Option A` |
| `<numbered> text` | `# text` | `# Step one` |
| `<heading1>X</heading1>` | `h1. X` | `h1. Title` |
| `<heading2>X</heading2>` | `h2. X` | `h2. Section` |
| `<heading3>X</heading3>` | `h3. X` | `h3. Subsection` |
| `<link>text\|url</link>` | `[text\|url]` | `[TS-24\|https://jira.example.com/browse/TS-24]` |
| `<image>url</image>` | `!url!` | `!https://.../diagram.png!` |
| `<image-thumb>url</image-thumb>` | `!url\|thumbnail!` | `!https://.../diagram.png\|thumbnail!` |
| `<quote>X</quote>` | `{quote}X{quote}` | `{quote}cited text{quote}` |
| `<panel>X</panel>` | `{panel}X{panel}` | `{panel}note{panel}` |
| `<color color="red">X</color>` | `{color:red}X{color}` | `{color:red}alert{color}` |
| `<hr>` | `----` | `----` |

## Rules

- Replace every placeholder tag with the Jira wiki markup shown above.
- Do NOT use Markdown syntax in Jira output: no `**bold**`, no `- item` bullets, no `# headings`, no triple backticks.
- Use `* item` for bullets and `# item` for numbered lists.
- For Mermaid diagrams in Jira fields that support them, wrap the diagram in `{code:mermaid}...{code}`.
- For plain preformatted blocks, use `{noformat}...{noformat}`.

## ⚠️ Common Markdown mistakes — NEVER do this in Jira output

- **NEVER use `**text**` for bold.** In Jira `**text**` is rendered as plain text with asterisks, not bold. Use `*text*` for bold.
- **NEVER use `*text*` for italic.** In Jira `*text*` means bold. Use `_text_` for italic.
- **NEVER use `## Heading`.** Use `h2. Heading`.
- **NEVER use triple backticks for code blocks.** Use `{code}...{code}` or `{code:lang}...{code}`.

## Full Jira wiki markup reference (Atlassian)

- `*text*` — bold
- `_text_` — italic
- `-text-` — strikethrough
- `+text+` — underline
- `^text^` — superscript
- `~text~` — subscript
- `{{text}}` — monospaced inline code
- `{code}...{code}` — code block
- `{code:java}...{code}` — language-specific code block
- `{noformat}...{noformat}` — preformatted block
- `[text\|url]` — link
- `!image.png!` — embedded image
- `h1.` ... `h6.` — headings
- `* item` — bullet list
- `# item` — numbered list
- `||header||header||` / `|cell|cell|` — tables
- `{quote}...{quote}` — block quote
- `{panel}...{panel}` — panel
- `{color:red}...{color}` — colored text
- `----` — horizontal rule
