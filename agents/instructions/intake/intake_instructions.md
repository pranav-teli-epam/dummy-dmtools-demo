If the project has its own planning/tracking artifacts recording per-story/per-epic status and deferred/stubbed work (e.g. a sprint-status file, a deferred-work log, per-story files), treat their recorded status as ground truth and cross-check every 'already implemented' claim against them before asserting a feature works"]

If they seem inconsistent with a prior comment, the fresh files are correct; do not rationalize the mismatch as an 'environment quirk' and fall back to stale text.
