**IMPORTANT** If a file named `instruction.md` exists in the repository root, read it before reviewing. Use it as the authoritative reference for the project's approved tech stack, deployment constraints, and frameworks — flag any implementation that deviates from what is defined there.

Read PR context from input folder which contains:
  - ticket.md: Full ticket details with requirements and acceptance criteria
  - pr_info.md: Pull Request metadata (URL, author, title, description)
  - pr_diff.txt: Complete git diff of all changes
  - pr_files.txt: List of all modified files
  - ci_failures.md: *(if present)* **CI checks currently failing** — treat each as a 🚨 BLOCKING issue and include in the review. Last 500 lines of each failed check log; full logs are in `ci_failures_full.log`.
  - pr_discussions.md: *(if present)* Full history of previous review comments and inline threads
  - pr_discussions_raw.json: *(if present)* Structured thread data with IDs — used to populate `resolvedThreadIds`

**If `ci_failures.md` is present**: The PR has failing CI checks. Include each failed check as a 🚨 BLOCKING finding in your review. Describe what the error log shows (last 500 lines are included in the file; full logs are in `ci_failures_full.log`) and what needs to be fixed. These are blocking — the PR must not be approved while CI is failing.

## ⚠️ Repeated Review Notice

**This may be a repeated review.** This workflow is cyclical:
- If previous review requested changes → ticket moved to "In Rework" → developer made fixes → PR updated → this review runs again

If `pr_discussions.md` is present in the input folder:
  - **Read it carefully before reviewing** — it contains all previous reviewer comments and inline threads
  - Check whether each previously raised issue has been **addressed or resolved** in the new diff
  - In your review summary, include a section **"Previous Issues Follow-up"** that explicitly states for each prior issue: ✅ Resolved / ❌ Still present / ⚠️ Partially addressed
  - Do **not** re-raise issues that are fully resolved — focus on what's still open or newly introduced

If `pr_discussions.md` is absent, this is the **first review** — no prior context to check.

Your task is to conduct a comprehensive Pull Request review with HIGHEST PRIORITY on:

## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
Scan for OWASP Top 10 and common vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Command Injection
  - Authentication/Authorization bypass
  - Sensitive data exposure (hardcoded secrets, keys, passwords)
  - Insecure deserialization
  - Insufficient input validation and sanitization
  - Path traversal vulnerabilities
  - Improper error handling leaking sensitive information

## 🏗️ Code Quality & OOP Principles (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - SOLID principles adherence
  - Design patterns usage and appropriateness
  - Code duplication and DRY violations
  - Proper abstraction levels
  - Encapsulation and information hiding
  - Separation of concerns
  - Cohesion and coupling
  - Naming conventions and code readability
  - Project architecture: flag violations of project-approved layering, data access, dependency direction, and framework conventions
  - Modern framework usage: flag outdated or non-idiomatic libraries only when the project stack clearly has an approved alternative

## ✅ Task Alignment
  - Verify implementation matches ticket requirements
  - Check all acceptance criteria are met
  - Identify any missing functionality from ticket scope
  - Flag any out-of-scope changes

### 🧪 Protected testing folder scope

This standard PR review is for development and rework agents, not test automation agents. Treat changes under the top-level `testing/` folder as protected-scope changes:

- If `pr_files.txt` or `pr_diff.txt` includes any path under `testing/`, look for a clear reason in `request.md`, `pr_info.md`, `comments.md`, or `pr_discussions.md`.
- A clear reason must explain why this non-testing PR needs to change the testing framework/assets/tests, and the change must be directly tied to the ticket or to fixing a broken test harness caused by the implementation.
- Generic statements like "updated tests", "fixed automation", or "cleanup" are not enough.
- If no clear reason exists, raise a 🚨 BLOCKING scope issue: development/rework agents must not modify `testing/` without explicit justification. Prefer an inline comment on the changed `testing/` line when possible; otherwise include it in the general comment.
- If a clear reason exists, review the `testing/` changes normally for correctness and minimality, and still flag unrelated broad rewrites.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
  - Test coverage adequacy
  - Edge cases and error scenarios handling
  - Test quality and maintainability

## 📝 Code Style & Best Practices
  - Consistency with codebase patterns
  - Error handling patterns
  - Logging and debugging considerations
  - Performance implications

**IMPORTANT**: Be thorough but constructive. Focus on:
  - 🚨 BLOCKING issues (security, critical bugs, scope violations)
  - ⚠️ IMPORTANT issues (code quality, OOP violations, missing tests)
  - 💡 SUGGESTIONS (improvements, optimizations, style)

## 🔄 Exhaustive Pattern Detection (CRITICAL)

**You MUST flag ALL instances of a problem in a single review pass.** Do NOT flag only 1–2 occurrences and leave the rest for later rounds. Each review-rework cycle is expensive (triggers CI, blocks the developer, wastes compute). Minimize cycles by being thorough in one pass.

When you find a pattern issue (e.g., missing `accessibilityLabel`, hardcoded colour, string literal `accessibilityRole`):
1. Search the **entire diff** for ALL occurrences of the same pattern
2. Flag every occurrence — either as individual inline comments or list them all in one comment
3. If the pattern also exists outside the diff (pre-existing code), mention it in the general comment but do NOT create inline comments for lines outside the diff

**Do NOT post "no action required" suggestions.** If a suggestion concludes that the current implementation is correct, acceptable, or "very low priority — no change needed", then do NOT post it. A suggestion must recommend a concrete change. Comments like "Consider X … but current approach is fine" are noise — they waste developer time and trigger unnecessary rework cycles.

## ⚠️ Inline Comments Policy

**If recommendation is APPROVE**: Do NOT write any inline comments or suggestions. The `inlineComments` array must be empty. The general comment should only briefly confirm the approval — no improvement suggestions, no minor notes.

**If recommendation is REQUEST_CHANGES or BLOCK**: Write inline comments only for BLOCKING and IMPORTANT issues. Do NOT add SUGGESTION-level inline comments. Minor improvements that do not affect correctness, security, or maintainability should not be posted.

**CRITICAL — Diff-only rule**: Inline comments can ONLY be placed on lines that appear in `pr_diff.txt` (lines inside a diff hunk, prefixed with `+` or context lines within the changed block). If a finding concerns a file or line that is **not present in the diff** (e.g. a pre-existing Dockerfile, a config file not touched in this PR), you MUST NOT create an inline comment for it. Instead, include the finding in the **general comment** section with the file path and line number noted as text. Violating this rule causes the GitHub API to reject the comment with a 422 error.

**Thread resolution rule**: When `pr_discussions.md` is present (repeated review), for each prior thread you confirmed is **fully fixed** in this rework, add its `threadId` (from `pr_discussions_raw.json` → `threads[i].threadId`) to `resolvedThreadIds` in `pr_review.json`. Resolved threads will be automatically marked as resolved on GitHub. Only add threads whose fix you verified in the diff — do NOT resolve threads that are still open or only partially addressed.

Write detailed review report to outputs/response.md following the formatting rules.

**DO NOT** create commits, branches, or modify any code - you are only reviewing.
