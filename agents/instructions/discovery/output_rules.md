## File naming (use exactly these names so re-runs update the same Confluence page instead of creating duplicates)

| File | Mode | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| `index.md` | — | Landing page: one-paragraph status, which mode(s) ran this session, dominant risk, the headline recommendation (one line, link to full `recommendations.md`), links to the other pages below, "Last iteration" note (date + delta summary) |
| `research-brief.md` | — (optional) | Decision framing, written BEFORE other modes on an ambiguous/high-stakes first run. See `modes.md`. |
| `recommendations.md` | — (always) | **Mandatory every run.** See "recommendations.md is mandatory" below |
| `opportunity-assessment.md` | 0 | Problem / who / alternatives / why now / success metrics / go-no-go |
| `domain-brief.md` | 1 | Domain / context explainer |
| `source-distillate.md` | 2 | Lossless compression of sources |
| `discovery-plan.md` | 3 | Known vs unknown, four (or more) risks, evidence bars |
| `as-is-to-be.md` | 4 | Current vs future flow, plus a Systems/Actors Overview table (see `modes.md`) |
| `mapping.md` | 5 | Field / interface / data-contract tables |
| `prd.md` | 6 | Discovery PRD (see `modes.md` for structure). Split into `prd/business-requirements.md` + `prd/technical-requirements.md` subfolder when the two genuinely need separate stakeholder audiences (business vs engineering) and are each substantial — otherwise a single `prd.md` is fine. |
| `experiments.md` | 7 | Proposed experiments for the dominant risk, with method + measurement contract (see `decision_and_governance.md`) |
| `readiness.md` | 8 | Four-risk readiness assessment + trio check, 4-state verdict |
| `decisions-log.md` | — (optional, append-only) | Running log of questions asked, decisions made, and action items, across the whole discovery lifetime. See below. |
| `references.md` | — (optional) | Consolidated index of every external artifact/link referenced anywhere in this discovery (specs, recordings, design docs, example files, diagrams). See below. |
| `publication-review.md` | — (optional) | Only when material sensitivity/governance concerns exist (see `decision_and_governance.md`'s governance gate) — records what was checked/redacted before broad publication and any concern still open. |

Do not invent additional top-level files beyond this table — but DO create subfolders under any of these when a topic's complexity genuinely warrants splitting it into several detail pages (e.g. `as-is-to-be/<stage-name>.md` per stage of a multi-stage process, or `mapping/<system-pair-name>.md` per pair of integrated systems). A predictable page tree does not mean a shallow one — depth is fine when the topic needs it; inventing sibling top-level files that duplicate an existing file's purpose is not.

## `decisions-log.md` — optional, append-only running log

Some discoveries are not a single AI session but an ongoing thread across many real conversations/meetings over weeks or months (the ticket accumulates comments, stakeholders answer questions in follow-up rounds, new decisions get made). For this kind of discovery, maintain `outputs/discovery/decisions-log.md` as a table:

`# | Area/Topic | Question | Decision | Action Item(s) | Date/Source`

Rules:
- **Never delete or rewrite prior rows.** Each run only ever **appends** new rows for genuinely new questions/decisions surfaced this run (from new ticket comments, new stakeholder input, or new investigation findings) — this file's whole value is the historical record.
- If a prior open question now has an answer, add a **new row** referencing the old one ("see row 3") rather than editing row 3's original text — the history of "what we didn't know when" is itself useful.
- Skip creating this file entirely for a single-session, one-shot discovery with no back-and-forth — don't create an empty or one-row log just to check a box.

## `references.md` — optional, consolidated reference index

When a discovery accumulates several external artifacts (design files, recorded calls, spec documents, example data files, diagrams, third-party docs), maintain `outputs/discovery/references.md` as a single table so a reader doesn't have to hunt through every sub-page to find the source material:

`# | Artifact | Link | Comments`

This is a **discovery-wide index**, distinct from the per-file "References" section `formatting_rules.md` requires at the bottom of individual files with several citations — that per-file section stays local to its file; `references.md` is the one place that aggregates everything across the whole discovery tree. Append new rows as new artifacts surface; don't remove old ones even if a topic they relate to is later dropped from scope (mark it `_out of scope_` in the Comments column instead).

## `publication-review.md` — optional, only when a governance concern actually exists

Most discoveries don't need this file. Create it only when the source material (ticket comments, attachments, interview notes) contained something covered by `decision_and_governance.md`'s publication/sensitivity governance gate — e.g. a real person's name/contact info, a secret, an unconsented direct quote, a cross-customer comparison, or a domain-sensitive (legal/safety/compliance) conclusion. Record: what was found, what was redacted/anonymized/paraphrased, and anything that couldn't be resolved this run and still needs a human decision before broad publication.

## `recommendations.md` is mandatory


⚠️ **Write this file every single run, no matter which mode(s) you ran or how thin the ticket was.** A discovery pass that only hands back gathered facts/pages with no actual answer is incomplete — the deliverable is a recommendation, not raw research.

Required content, **in this order** (the challenge step MUST come before the bottom line is finalized — see below):

1. **Challenge the idea first** — before concluding anything, actively argue the OPPOSING case: why this should NOT be built / why "no-go" or "kill it" could be right. Required sub-questions:
   - Does this duplicate an existing feature, tool, or vendor already in use (internally or in the market) that solves the same job cheaper/faster?
   - What is the cost of doing nothing, and is it actually worse than the cost/risk of building this?
   - What's the strongest steelman argument a skeptical stakeholder would make against proceeding?
   - Only after writing this section does the bottom line get decided — if the challenge case is stronger than the case for proceeding, the bottom line MUST reflect that (no-go / kill / defer), not a "go" reached by ignoring your own challenge.
2. **Bottom line** (one sentence): go / explore-further / no-go, or — for a feature/task-shaped ticket — build it / don't build it / build a smaller version, stated as a direct answer, not a hedge, and consistent with the challenge section above.
3. **Proposal** — the specific direction being recommended: which feature/approach/technology/next step, in concrete terms a stakeholder could act on today (not "we should look into options"). Use a numbered list or table for a multi-step proposal (phase | timeline | outcome) — Mermaid is NOT the default here (see `formatting_rules.md`'s Mermaid caveat).
4. **Why** — the 2-4 findings (from your investigation — web research, codebase, linked docs) that most drove the recommendation, each with a real Markdown link to its source.
5. **Evidence against** — the material counter-evidence you found (see `evidence_and_methods.md`'s "Searching for evidence against") even if it didn't change the bottom line — do not suppress a contradiction just to make the recommendation read cleaner.
6. **Answers to open questions** — for every open question you would otherwise raise, give your best-supported answer/hypothesis first (labeled `**Recommended answer:**`, with rationale and confidence), and only fall back to a bare unresolved "Open question — needs human input" for the genuinely undecidable ones (e.g. depends on a business decision, budget, or legal/compliance call no source can answer). A table (question | recommended answer | confidence | source) is preferred over prose.
7. **What could change the recommendation** — the specific new evidence that would flip it (keeps the recommendation honest and falsifiable, not just an opinion).

This is not the same as "no invention" (see `general_guidelines.md`) — a recommendation is explicitly your reasoned judgment call, clearly labeled as such, built on the facts you gathered. Labeling it as a recommendation (not a fact) is what keeps it honest. The challenge step exists specifically to counter confirmation bias — do not skip it or treat it as a formality to get through before writing the "real" (positive) recommendation.

## Cross-linking

Link between your own files with plain relative Markdown links, e.g. `[see the PRD](prd.md)` or `[mapping details](mapping.md)` — the Confluence sync step rewrites these into real Confluence page links automatically. Do not use absolute file paths or guess Confluence page IDs yourself.

⚠️ **The link text must always be a natural-language phrase — never the bare filename.** This is not just a style preference: Confluence's link-safety UI shows a "Check this link — this is taking you to a different site" interstitial click-through warning whenever the visible link text doesn't resemble the resolved destination, and a bare filename (`as-is-to-be.md`, `prd.md`) never resembles a Confluence page title/URL, so it reliably triggers that warning on every single click — even though the link itself is a correct, internal, same-space reference. A natural-language phrase describing what the reader will find avoids this entirely.

- ❌ `See [as-is-to-be.md](as-is-to-be.md) for the full current vs. future flow.`
- ✅ `See [the AS IS / TO BE flow](as-is-to-be.md) for the full current vs. future flow.`
- ❌ `<code>prd.md</code>` as a table cell's only content
- ✅ `[PRD draft](prd.md)` or `[the PRD](prd.md)` as the table cell's content

This applies equally to `index.md`'s own "pages produced this run" table (see the file-naming table above) — link the descriptive title, not the filename. If you want the raw filename visible too for orientation, put it in a separate non-linked `` `filename.md` `` note next to the real link, don't make the filename itself the clickable text.

## Re-runs / iteration

⚠️ **On an iteration run, `outputs/discovery/` is NOT empty when you start** — the pre-CLI step seeds it with the last published Confluence content, recursively at every depth of the existing page tree (same file/subfolder naming as the table above), before you run. **Read what's already there first, including any nested subfolders.** Then **edit the same file in place** with the merged result (old content + this run's delta) rather than deleting it and starting fresh — this keeps the same Confluence page updated instead of creating a duplicate tree, and guarantees nothing you didn't intend to touch gets silently dropped. This applies to `recommendations.md` too: re-affirm, sharpen, or revise the recommendation based on any new artefact — don't leave a stale recommendation unexamined.

**Exception — append-only files:** `decisions-log.md` and `references.md` are never rewritten wholesale on iteration, even though they're seeded the same way as everything else. Read their existing rows, then only **append** new rows for what this run actually added — see their own sections above for why (they're a historical record, not current-state).

## Before you finish — mandatory final checklist

A long discovery session can run out of time/turns right before these last, cheap steps — do them **as your very last actions**, even if you are running low on budget, since skipping them silently discards work you already did:

1. **`outputs/response.md`** — write a short (a few sentences) summary of what you did this run (which mode(s) ran, the headline recommendation, whether any inline comments were addressed). This file is required by the runner framework regardless of `outputType` — if it is missing, the ticket update is skipped and an error is posted instead, even when every `outputs/discovery/*` file above is correct.
2. **`outputs/confluence_replies.json`** — if you addressed (or explicitly declined to address) any unresolved comment from `input/<ticket>/discovery_comments.json`, this file must list a reply for it (see `confluence_comments.md`). A missing file is silently treated as "no replies to post" — it will NOT surface as an error, so double-check it yourself before finishing.

Verify both before finishing:
```bash
ls -la outputs/ outputs/discovery/ && head -3 outputs/response.md && echo "OK: response.md exists"
```
If either file is missing, create it now — do not leave it for a future run.
