# Solution Design Output Format

Write the enhanced SD CORE technical description to `outputs/response.md` and a valid Mermaid diagram to `outputs/diagram.md`.

The block below is a **structural template / example only**. The tags such as `<bold>`, `<bullet>`, `<code>`, and `<link>` are placeholders that show the required shape of the document.

**CRITICAL: Never write the final `outputs/response.md` using these literal metatags.** Use the tracker-specific transformation table (for example `agents/instructions/tracker/jira_markup_transform.md` when the tracker is Jira) to convert every placeholder into the correct tracker markup.

```
<bold>Purpose:</bold>
[One-paragraph summary of the solution goal and scope.]

<bold>Background and Constraints:</bold>
<bullet> Existing workflow, system, or business constraint.
<bullet> Relevant prior decision or dependency.
<bullet> Non-negotiable technical or process limitation.

<bold>Architecture Decisions:</bold>
<bullet> Decision: [chosen approach] — Rationale: [why it fits best].
<bullet> Decision: [alternative considered and rejected] — Rationale: [trade-off].

<bold>Component Responsibilities:</bold>
<bullet> <code>ComponentName</code>: [what it does and how it interacts with others].
<bullet> <code>AnotherComponent</code>: [responsibility].

<bold>Data Flow:</bold>
<bullet> Step 1: [actor / trigger → component].
<bullet> Step 2: [component → component / store].
<bullet> Step 3: [result / side effect].

<bold>API Contracts:</bold>
<bullet> <code>POST /api/example</code>: [request payload shape] → [response shape].
<bullet> <code>GET /api/example/{id}</code>: [purpose and return shape].
<bullet> [If a new/changed enum or literal id value is introduced here and another repository will hardcode it verbatim: call out here that the consuming repo's implementation MUST verify the exact literal against the actual merged source of truth (not just this design doc) before its change merges, and should cover it with a test that fails if the source value ever drifts — not one that only mocks the id locally.]

<bold>AC Coverage:</bold>
The Acceptance Criteria are defined in the BA ticket (<link>BA-TICKET|https://jira.example.com/browse/BA-TICKET</link>) and are the single source of truth.
<bullet> AC1 (Feature Display) → Addressed by [component / flow].
<bullet> AC2 (Dialog Content) → Addressed by [component / flow].
<bullet> AC3 (Core Logic) → Addressed by [component / flow].
<bullet> AC4 (Error Handling) → Addressed by [component / flow].

<bold>Out of Scope:</bold>
<bullet> Item deliberately not covered by this solution.

<bold>Risks and Security Notes:</bold>
<bullet> Risk: [description] — Mitigation: [approach].
<bullet> Security: [credential, secret, or permission consideration].
```

## Rules

- The template above is a structural example. Replace every `<bold>`, `<italic>`, `<strike>`, `<underline>`, `<code>`, `<codeblock>`, `<bullet>`, `<numbered>`, `<heading1>`, `<heading2>`, `<heading3>`, `<link>`, `<image>`, `<quote>`, `<panel>`, `<color>`, and `<hr>` placeholder with the equivalent markup defined in the tracker-specific transformation table.
- Do NOT leave literal XML-style tags such as `<bold>` or `<code>` in the final `outputs/response.md`.
- Do NOT use Markdown syntax in Jira output: no `**bold**`, no `- item` bullets, no `# headings`, no triple backticks.
- Use the tracker-specific link format when referencing tickets or URLs.
- Write the Mermaid diagram to `outputs/diagram.md` following `common/diagram_output_contract.md` exactly (plain Mermaid syntax, no fences, no markup tags).
