# Runs a local SpotBugs "new findings only" check, scoped ONLY to lines actually
# added/changed by the current branch — a fast local approximation of how modern
# SAST/SonarQube gates report "new issues" instead of every pre-existing finding.
#
# Why this exists: `mvn spotbugs:check` scoped only by MAVEN MODULE (compiling and
# checking every changed file's containing module) still re-flags every PRE-EXISTING
# finding across the ENTIRE touched module — including legacy technical debt the
# current change never touched. On a large legacy codebase this routinely fails the
# gate on unrelated findings that have nothing to do with the actual diff, which then
# forces exclude-file / suppression-plugin workarounds just to get an unrelated gate
# to pass — churn that fights code review (reviewers reasonably ask "why is this
# unrelated suppression config here?") and can flip back and forth across review
# rounds. This script gives a precise "did THIS diff introduce a new finding" signal
# instead, so pre-existing findings elsewhere in the module no longer block the gate.
#
# How it works:
#   1. Diff HEAD against a base ref (arg 3; or, if omitted, the branch named in
#      ../../outputs/pr_base_branch.txt — see js/common/baseBranchMarker.js — used as
#      "origin/<that branch>" if it resolves; or auto-detected origin/master /
#      origin/main as a last resort) to find changed *.java files.
#   2. Map each changed file to its Maven module (nearest ancestor pom.xml).
#   3. Run `mvn spotbugs:spotbugs` (report-only — does NOT fail the build) scoped to
#      those modules (NOT -am, matching the compile gate's convention of installing
#      the full reactor first so scoped module builds can resolve cross-module
#      dependencies from the local repo), producing each module's
#      target/spotbugsXml.xml.
#   4. Parse every <BugInstance>'s <SourceLine sourcepath="..." start="N" end="M"/>
#      and keep only findings whose sourcepath matches one of the changed files AND
#      whose [start,end] line range overlaps that file's *added* line numbers (same
#      diff-hunk-parsing approach as coverage_diff_scope.sh's "new code" definition).
#   5. Fail (exit 1) only if any such NEW findings remain after filtering, with a
#      per-finding breakdown. Pre-existing findings elsewhere in the module (or on
#      lines this diff didn't touch) are ignored — no excludeFilterFile/suppression
#      config is needed for this gate to pass.
#   6. If no changed .java file maps to a module, or no findings land on changed
#      lines, the check passes (exit 0).
#
# ⚠️ If THIS check fails, the fix is: fix the actual bug SpotBugs flagged in the new/
# changed lines it lists (or, if it's a deliberate false positive, add a scoped
# @SuppressFBWarnings annotation on that specific method/field — not a broad
# excludeFilterFile/spotbugs-exclude.xml that also silences unrelated legacy findings).
#
# Usage:
#   bash spotbugs_diff_scope.sh <maven-root> <settings-path-relative-to-cwd> [base-ref]
#
# Example (settings.xml lives at the repo checkout root, consistent with the
# preceding compile/coverage gates):
#   bash agents/scripts/spotbugs_diff_scope.sh tools-app mvn/settings.xml
#
# Must be run with the working directory set to the target repo checkout (same
# `workingDir` used by the other feedbackLoop.qualityGates gate commands).
