# Run the full AI Teammate pipeline locally and synchronously — no GitHub Actions
# runner involved. Mirrors the "Install AI Teammate tools" + "Run AI Teammate" steps
# of ai-teammate.yml, but executes `dmtools run` directly on the calling machine.
#
# Invoked by js/smAgent.js when a rule has `localTeammate: true` instead of
# dispatching a workflow_dispatch. Can also be run standalone for manual/ad-hoc runs.
#
# Usage:
#   run-teammate-local.sh --config-file agents/story_development.json --ticket PROJ-123 \
#     [--encoded-config-file PATH] [--project-key myproject] [--base-branch main] \
#     [--install-tools "java:17 node:20 dmtools:v1.7.215"] [--dmtools-bin PATH]
#
# Secrets:
#   Read from the calling shell's environment first; any variable not already set is
#   filled in from ./dmtools.env if present (same KEY=VALUE format used by
#   scripts/run-agent.sh). Real environment variables always win — dmtools.env only
#   fills gaps. Typical required vars: JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_API_TOKEN, JIRA_BASE_PATH,
#   GH_TOKEN/PAT_TOKEN, and whatever the configured AI_AGENT_PROVIDER needs
#   (e.g. COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN, CURSOR_API_KEY).
#
# Branch handling (no git worktrees — single checkout, reused across tickets):
#   Before every ticket this script syncs --base-branch (default: main) and REFUSES
#   to proceed if the working tree is dirty (protects any uncommitted local work,
#   including a previous run that failed to commit/push). The teammate agent's own
#   postJSAction is responsible for creating/checking out the ticket branch,
#   committing, and pushing — exactly as it does on a GitHub Actions runner. After a
#   successful run the tree must be clean again; if it isn't, this script fails
#   loudly instead of silently discarding or carrying over uncommitted changes into
#   the next ticket.
#
# Concurrency: an exclusive flock on <repo>/.git/dmtools-local-run.lock serializes
# any two invocations against the same repo dir (e.g. two overlapping SM runs each
# dispatching localTeammate tickets) — the second one blocks and waits its turn
# instead of racing the first on git fetch/checkout/pull.
