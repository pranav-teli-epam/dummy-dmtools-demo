# Fails with a clear message if any of the given environment variable names are
# unset or empty. Used as a "hard prerequisite" setup-command gate so that
# cli_execute_command (whose validateNoShellInjection() rejects any command
# string containing &&, ||, ;, |, $(...), ${...}) can invoke a single simple
# "bash check_required_env_vars.sh VAR1 VAR2 ..." call — all the actual
# conditional logic lives here in the script file, which is NOT subject to
# that shell-metacharacter restriction.
#
# Usage:
#   bash check_required_env_vars.sh MY_REQUIRED_VAR1 MY_REQUIRED_VAR2
