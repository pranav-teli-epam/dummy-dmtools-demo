# Directory where the full, untruncated CLI-agent provider transcript (Claude
# Code / Copilot / Cursor / Kimi / Codemie stdout+stderr) is persisted.
#
# Every provider used to `tee` its raw output to a `mktemp` file, grep it once
# for codegraph usage / session-id extraction, then `rm -f` it — so the actual
# conversation the agent had was never recoverable after the job finished,
# even though `record_codegraph_usage` had already looked at it. That is the
# single biggest source of "blind" CI runs: unlike nested `dmtools run`
# subprocess output (capped/persisted on the Java side via
# CommandLineUtils/DMTOOLS_CLI_LOG_DIR), the top-level agent's own transcript
# was never written anywhere durable at all.
#
# Uses the SAME .dmtools-logs/cli root as DMTOOLS_CLI_LOG_DIR on the Java side
# (see CommandLineUtils.java / PropertyReader.getCliFullOutputLogDir) so a
# single CI artifact glob (.dmtools-logs/**) picks up both nested `dmtools run`
# transcripts and the top-level provider CLI transcript.

# When a provider resumes a previously cached CLI session (Claude Code
# --resume, Copilot --resume, Cursor --resume, Kimi --session), the model
# carries over its full prior conversation history/memory, including
# assumptions about input/*.md files it already looked at in an earlier run.
# Those files (comments.md, confluence_output_comments.md, request.md, ...)
# are regenerated fresh on every job run and can contain materially new
# content (e.g. new inline comments), but a resumed model can silently skip
# re-reading them because it "remembers" checking them before — even when
# the prompt explicitly instructs it to read them.
#
# The fix is deliberately NOT "paste the full prompt text again, with a
# warning on top": pasting the same (or near-same) content into the
# conversation body again is exactly the kind of thing a resumed model can
# pattern-match as "I've already seen this" and skim past. Instead, on an
# actual resume, the message body sent to the model is kept SHORT and simply
# points at the real prompt file on disk, instructing the model to open it
# with its own Read tool right now. Making the model perform a concrete,
# observable tool call to fetch the current file content is a much stronger
# guarantee of a fresh read than re-including text it may treat as familiar.
#
# Every provider that supports session resume should use this pair of
# helpers, but ONLY when a resume is actually happening (an existing session
# was found and is being continued) — never for a brand-new session, which
# should keep sending the full prompt inline as before (it has no prior-turn
# memory to distrust, and forcing an extra Read round-trip there would just
# be wasted latency).

# Ensures the full prompt text is available at a stable file path, reusing
# PROMPT_ARG if DMTools already passed the prompt as a file (the normal CI
# path), or materializing $PROMPT into a fresh temp file otherwise. Echoes
# the absolute path on stdout. Callers that receive a freshly created temp
# file (i.e. PROMPT_ARG was NOT already a file) are responsible for removing
# it once the CLI invocation that reads it has finished.

**IMPORTANT — resumed session:** this is a re-run of this job for the same ticket. Do NOT rely on memory from a previous turn — the \`input/\` folder has been freshly re-downloaded for this run and may contain new or changed content (ticket description, comments, tracker page content, inline comments) compared to what you saw before.

Your full instructions for this run are in this file (they are NOT repeated here on purpose):
  ${prompt_file}

Use your file-read tool to open and read that file IN FULL right now — do not skip this step just because you resumed this session — then follow it exactly, including re-reading every file it references under \`input/\` (\`request.md\`, \`comments.md\`, \`confluence_output_comments.md\`, \`confluence_output_current.md\`, etc.) from scratch.

# Coding-agent CLIs (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, etc.) typically run their Bash
# tool as ONE persistent shell across the whole session — a `cd` in one tool
# call carries over to every later call, including the final `Write` of
# outputs/response.md (or outputs/pr_review.json, outputs/pr_review_comments/*.md,
# etc). When an agent explores a dependency checkout (`cd dependencies/<repo>
# && ...`) to read source while producing its own output, and never `cd`s
# back to the job root before writing outputs/*, those files silently land
# under dependencies/<repo>/outputs/... instead of ./outputs/. The agent's own
# tool result still reports success ("File created successfully at:
# outputs/response.md") because that path really was created — just relative
# to the wrong cwd. Left undetected, dmtools then reports "did not produce
# output file", skips the Jira field update, and posts a giant raw-log
# fallback comment that itself is too long to post — a fully silent failure
# with no usable content anywhere.
#
# This rescues ANY output file misplaced this way — not just response.md —
# by searching for other outputs/ directories created/modified since
# start_output_rescue_marker() was called, and copying their newer files up
# into the job's own ./outputs/. It never overwrites a file that's already
# correctly present at the real ./outputs/ path (that one is trusted as
# authoritative).
