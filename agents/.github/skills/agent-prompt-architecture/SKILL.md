  Guidance for keeping dmtools-agents prompt/config architecture generic and

# Agent Prompt Architecture

## Core rule

`dmtools-agents` is a generic agents repository. It must not contain customer,
project, repository, ticket, branch, or technology rules that belong to a target
project.

Put reusable behavior here. Put project context in the target repo.

## Prompt layers

Use small files and compose them explicitly:

```text
agents/
  prompts/                         # generic entry prompts
  instructions/
    review/                        # review behavior
    rework/                        # rework behavior
    development/                   # implementation behavior
    tracker/                       # Jira / ADO / generic work item formatting
    scm/                           # GitHub / ADO PR formatting
    platform/                      # reusable web/mobile/backend/database rules

target-repo/
  .dmtools/
    config.js                      # project composition
    prompts/                       # project role/context/focus
    instructions/                  # project architecture/platform rules
```

### Generic files may contain

- Agent role and task contract.
- Input/output contract.
- Provider-neutral wording: ticket/work item, SCM, PR, CI checks.
- Generic quality rules: correctness, security, maintainability, tests.
- Provider-specific rules only inside explicit provider folders:
  - `instructions/tracker/*`
  - `instructions/scm/*`

### Generic files must not contain

- Real project names, ticket keys, repo paths, or customer names.
- Target repo branch names, workflow names, labels, or pipeline details.
- Product-specific business rules.
- Technology rules that only one project needs.
- Links to private project documentation.

## Composition model

For CLI agents with `skipAIProcessing=true`, prefer direct CLI prompt surfaces:

```js
module.exports = {
    cliPrompts: {
        story_development: [
            './.dmtools/prompts/project_context.md',
            './.dmtools/prompts/development_focus.md',
            './agents/instructions/platform/backend_architecture.md'
        ],
        pr_review: [
            './.dmtools/prompts/reviewer_role.md',
            './.dmtools/prompts/review_focus.md',
            './agents/instructions/review/core.md',
            './agents/instructions/scm/github_pr_review_format.md'
        ]
    },

    cliPromptOverrides: {
        pr_review: './.dmtools/prompts/pr_review_prompt.md'
    },

    agentParamPatches: {
        story_development: {
            aiRole: 'Senior Software Engineer'
        }
    },

    additionalInstructions: {
        story_solution: [
            './.dmtools/instructions/product/domain_knowledge.md'
        ]
    }
};
```

Use:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `cliPrompt` | Generic default entry prompt in agent JSON |
| `cliPrompts.<agent>` | Project/provider/platform modules appended to the CLI prompt |
| `cliPromptOverrides.<agent>` | Replace the default entry prompt for one project |
| `agentParamPatches.<agent>` | Patch `params.agentParams` without copying full JSON |
| `instructionOverrides.<agent>` | Replace `agentParams.instructions` |
| `additionalInstructions.<agent>` | Non-CLI/DMtools AI context, not the main CLI prompt channel |

## Creating a new CLI Teammate JSON

Use `Teammate` configs for CLI-agent workflows where dmtools prepares context,
the CLI agent performs the work, and post-actions publish the result.

The JSON `"name"` is a dmtools job class name. Keep it exactly `"Teammate"`.

Minimal pattern:

```json
{
  "name": "Teammate",
  "params": {
    "metadata": {
      "contextId": "story_development"
    },
    "agentParams": {
      "aiRole": "Senior Software Engineer",
      "instructions": [
        "./agents/instructions/development/implementation_instructions.md"
      ],
      "knownInfo": "",
      "formattingRules": "",
      "fewShots": ""
    },
    "cliPrompt": "./agents/prompts/story_development_prompt.md",
    "cliPrompts": [
      "./agents/prompts/bash_tools.md"
    ],
    "cliCommands": [
      "./agents/scripts/run-agent.sh"
    ],
    "outputType": "none",
    "skipAIProcessing": true,
    "alwaysPostComments": true,
    "ticketContextDepth": 1,
    "inputJql": "key = WORK-123"
  }
}
```

Best practices:

- Keep generic JSON in `agents/`; put project-specific prompt composition in the
  target repo's `.dmtools/config.js`.
- Keep `agentParams` small and compatibility-focused.
- Put role, project context, provider format, and platform focus in
  `cliPrompts` files instead of long inline strings.
- Use `metadata.contextId` to identify the workflow in logs and output.
- Keep `cliCommands` stable and delegate project behavior to prompt/config files.
- Add `preJSAction`, `preCliJSAction`, and `postJSAction` only when runtime
  behavior is required.
- Never copy a production JSON config only to change prompts. Prefer
  `cliPrompts`, `cliPromptOverrides`, or `agentParamPatches`.
- Validate JSON after every edit.

## Output JSON discipline

Agents often write JSON output files that are consumed by post-actions or CI.
Treat those files as machine contracts.

Rules:

- Always write valid JSON when a JSON output file is required.
- Validate generated JSON before finishing the agent run.
- Keep JSON compact: status, counters, paths, IDs, and short summaries.
- Do not put large markdown bodies, stack traces, logs, or generated reports
  directly inside JSON fields.
- If a large markdown/text body is needed, write it to a separate `.md` or `.txt`
  file and put only the file path/reference in JSON.
- Prefer:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "failed",
    "summary": "1 failing scenario",
    "detailsFile": "outputs/bug_description.md"
  }
  ```
  over embedding the full bug report in `"summary"` or `"details"`.
- If JSON parsing fails, fix the JSON before any post-action consumes it.

## Path stability

Do not move production JSON config paths unless the workflow/Jira/ADO entrypoints
are being migrated in the same change.

Safe refactors:

- Split prompt markdown into smaller files.
- Add `cliPrompts` in target `.dmtools/config.js`.
- Move project rules from generic prompts to target repo prompt packs.
- Add provider/platform modules under `agents/instructions/*`.

Risky refactors:

- Moving `*.json` configs used by CI.
- Renaming workflow inputs or `config_file` values.
- Moving target repo custom JS actions.

## GraalJS constraints

Production agent JS runs in dmtools GraalJS, not Node.js.

Do not use Node-only APIs in runtime agent files:

- `fs`, `path`, `process`, `Buffer`, `child_process`, npm packages.
- Browser-only APIs such as `fetch`, `window`, `document`.
- Shelling out unless the agent already uses an approved dmtools tool for it.

Use GraalJS-safe patterns:

- `var` declarations and plain functions.
- Local `require('./module.js')` only for repository JS modules supported by the
  agent runner.
- JSON-safe data structures.
- Existing dmtools MCP/tool globals such as `jira_*`, `ado_*`, `github_*`,
  `file_read`, and project wrappers.
- Explicit error returns or throws consistent with nearby agent code.

Unit tests may run in Node.js and provide mocks, but runtime code must stay
GraalJS-compatible.

## Refactor checklist

1. Identify whether each rule is generic, provider-specific, platform-specific,
   or project-specific.
2. Keep generic rules in `agents/`.
3. Put provider-specific formatting in `instructions/tracker` or
   `instructions/scm`.
4. Put project rules in the target repo under `.dmtools/` or the existing
   project config/prompt folder.
5. Wire small prompt files through `cliPrompts`.
6. Keep JSON config paths stable unless explicitly migrating workflows.
7. Validate changed agent JSON configs.
8. Validate required output JSON contracts if the agent writes JSON files.
9. Run existing JS unit tests.
10. Search for accidental project leakage before opening a PR.
