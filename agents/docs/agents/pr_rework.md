# pr rework

Reworks a pull request after review: reads review comments, implements the requested fixes, and pushes updates to the PR branch.

## Parameters

Configured via `customParams` in the agent JSON or the project `.dmtools/config.js` (project values win).

- `autoStartReview` — when `true`, automatically trigger the PR review workflow after this agent finishes.
- `autoStartReviewConfigFile` — agent config file used for the auto-started review workflow.
- `branchCreateFnPath` — path to a JS hook that creates the feature branch (two-branch flow customization).
- `branchSyncFnPath` — path to a JS hook that syncs the base branch before rebasing.
- `cacheToReleases` — when enabled, caches the workspace into a git release so later runs restore instead of re-cloning.
- `checkOpenPR` — when `true`, skip tickets that already have an open pull request for this work.
- `removeLabel` — label removed from the ticket after a successful run (idempotency cleanup).
- `removeLabels` — list of labels removed from the ticket after a successful run.
- `scmProvider` — SCM provider override (`github`, `gitlab`, …) for this run.
- `targetRepository` — repository override block (`owner`, `repo`, `baseBranch`, `workingDir`) — run the work against this repository instead of the project default.
